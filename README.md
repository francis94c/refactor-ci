# refactor-ci

A PHP (code Igniter) Library for easily refactoring associative arrays (remove key-vals, rename keys, & inflate a value with respective objects from a mysql table based off provided primary key values). You'll find this library useful if you want to return payloads which should have different keys than what they exist as in the database.
